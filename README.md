## About The Project
StockAlert is the front-end project to the StockWatch 
https://github.com/zackjohnson8/StockWatch project. StockAlert makes it easy to
view stock data and receive alerts when a stock reaches a certain price. I 
wanted to create a project that would allow me and others to easily view stock 
information without logging into a brokerage account.

## Getting Started
Simple, just clone the repository and launch the code in your favorite iOS 
development IDE (I.E XCode or AppCode).

## Usage
TODO: Add usage instructions

## Roadmap
- [x] Design the UI/UX
- [ ] Implement the front-end design with minimal back-end
- [ ] Implement the back-end functionality
